# Study of Periodic Modeling of Neural ODEs

study the performance of neural ODE family of models on datastes that exhibit periodic behaviors. 

## Datasets

Included datasets:
- univariate time-series with periodic behavior. 
- multivariate time-series with global periodic behavior . 
- multivariate time-series with local periodic behavior. 

include multiple domains, including physics (classical mechanics, fluid dynamics, molecular dynamics, weather, ocean/climate), finance (stock price, interest rate, foreign exchange), and urband dynamics (traffic).
