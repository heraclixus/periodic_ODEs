# periodic_ODEs

study the performance of neural ODE family of models on datastes that exhibit periodic behaviors. 

Included datasets:
- univariate time-series with periodic behavior. 
- multivariate time-series with global periodic behavior . 
- multivariate time-series with local periodic behavior. 

included models: 
- ODE-Net
- Neural ODE
- Latent Neural ODE
- Neural SDE
- Latent Neural SDE
- Lateng Graph ODE
- Higher order NODE
- Higher order graph ODE.
